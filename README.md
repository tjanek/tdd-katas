Build Version Comparator Kata
----------------------------------

Comparator that compares two build version values.
Build versions are made of some numbers separated by dots.

For example:

* 1
* 1.3.1
* 2.0.178.14.10

FizzBuzz Kata
--------------

Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
Instead of numbers for multiples of three prints "Fizz", for the multiples of five prints "Buzz"
and for multiples of both three and five prints "FizzBuzz".
