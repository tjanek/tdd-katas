Tennis Game Kata
-------------------

In a game of tennis, a player starts with a score of 0 and earns more points in this sequence:

0, 15, 30, 40, win

If a player has 40 and scores again that player wins the game as long as the other player does not also have
40 points. If both players reach 40 points it is referred to as "deuce".
 
Scoring during deuce gives a player advantage. If the other player scores again the score returns to deuce.
If a player has advantage and scores again, that player wins the game.
