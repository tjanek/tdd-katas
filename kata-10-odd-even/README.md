For a specified range of numbers, eg. from 1 to 100:

* if number is odd (divisible by 2 but not divisible by itself), print 'Odd' instead of the number  
* if number is even (divisible by 2), print 'Even' instead of number
* else if number is prime (does not meet above two conditions), print number
